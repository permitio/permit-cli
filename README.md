The **Permit CLI** is an open-source command-line utility that empowers developers with everything related to [Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://www.permit.io/blog/what-is-fine-grained-authorization-fga) and Identity and Access Management (IAM). It is a one-stop solution for handling all your authorization needs, seamlessly integrating with tools like OPA, OPAL, CEDAR, AVP, OpenFGA, and the Permit.io service.

> :bulb: Permit CLI is fully open-source and actively accepts [contributions of many cool features](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/issues). Leverage your open-source game by [contributing](https://github.com/permitio/permit-cli/issues) and giving it a :star:

## Development

Permit CLI is based on Pastel, a library for building CLI applications using React-like syntax. The project is written in TypeScript and uses `tsc` to run the CLI commands in development.

### Setup Development Environment

- Checkout this repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
- Use the CLI with the following convention `node ./dist/cli.js command [options]`

### Add New Commands

To add a new command, you need to create a new file in the `src/commands` directory with the command name. The project is using the Pastel library to create the CLI commands. You can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/pastel?tab=readme-ov-file#commands)

For a detailed command contribution guide, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### Write Tests

Permit CLI enforce UT coverage level of >90% for the code in main.

The CLI uses [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/) as its test framework. It also uses [`ink-testing-library`](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink-testing-library) to render the `Ink` components.

- run `npm run tests` for testing and coverage
