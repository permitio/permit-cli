## Writing Tests

When writing new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new test file in the appropriate directory (e.g., `source/commands` or `source/components`).
2. Use the existing test files as examples for writing your tests.
3. Ensure that your tests cover edge cases and different scenarios.
4. Run the tests locally to ensure they pass before committing your changes.
